## Fact-Grounded Attention: Eliminating Hallucination in Large Language Models Through Attention-Level Knowledge Integration

**Author**: Aayush Gupta

This paper presents Fact-Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into deterministic truth-tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the attention mechanism.

## Key Features

- **1,107 experimental queries** across smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles
- **99.7% accuracy** with FGA vs 6.3% baseline accuracy
- **Sub-second knowledge updates** without retraining
- **Three intuitive visualizations** explaining the mathematical framework
- **Open-source implementation** available at the GitHub repository

## Paper Highlights

- Single-column format (14-15 pages)
- Comprehensive mathematical framework with dimensional analysis
- Extensive experimental validation across three domains
- Memorable quotes throughout for impact
- Complete implementation details and dataset information
